# Writing Samples

Welcome to my portfolio! To learn more about me, see [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amyreyes/).

Most of my work is confidential, but here are a few examples that I can share:

- [ACRN Configuration and Development Overview](https://projectacrn.github.io/3.0/getting-started/overview_dev.html): Introduces hypervisor developers to the general ACRN development process, including ACRN components and tools. I created this document based on workflows and other information from the developer experience (DX) architect and engineering team. Then iterated it based on user feedback. I contracted an external vendor to create the images.

- [ACRN Getting Started Guide](https://projectacrn.github.io/3.0/getting-started/getting-started.html): Shows how to set up a simple ACRN hypervisor configuration on a target system. I edited the guide's earliest draft, provided by the engineering team, from an editorial perspective. I also walked through the guide multiple times with a Linux development computer and target board and provided feedback on issues I encountered. Together with the *ACRN Configuration and Development Overview*, received a 90% DX assessment score for helping with initial understanding and setup.

- [Intel速 BMP Installation Guide](pdf/writing-sample-334815-002-intel-bmp-installation-guide.pdf): Shows how to install a gateway device that collects data from sensors in buildings and sends the data to a cloud-based management service. I created this document based on input from the engineering and marketing teams. I also used the product software to inform my writing and take screenshots.

- [Intel速 BMP Release Notes](pdf/writing-sample-335025-003-intel-bmp-v1-0-release-notes.pdf): Describes software that runs on the aforementioned gateways. I formatted the content to conform to the standard Intel release notes template.

- [Welch Allyn Connex速 VM Administrator Guide](pdf/writing-sample-80015957c-connex-vm-administrator-guide.pdf): Covers information related to configuring, managing, and troubleshooting a Connex速 VM software system, which enables users to collect data from medical devices, edit data, and send data to a hospital information system. To create this document, I worked closely with the engineering team to gather content, and I used the product to write step-by-step procedures.
